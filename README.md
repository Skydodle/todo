## Setup
After cloning to local machine, navigate to `frontend-todo` folder
1. To install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
2. To run client dev (has built in webpack from react script):
```
npm start
```
Browser should open http://localhost:3000

## Future Development
I started in the `frontend-todo` folder because this the frontend only version.
My plan is to make the following versions in the future:
- Typescript frontend: convert frontend only into typescript
- Backend only: using Node, Express, PostgreSQL
- Fullstack: a fullstack version combining front and back
